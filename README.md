#Welcome to cfDashboard
---
This is the code example I made for the the cfObjective 2012 session on [Creating Enterprise Dashboards with ColdFusion](http://www.cfobjective.com/sessions/creating-enterprise-dashboards-with-coldfusion/).

#Getting Started
---
A couple of things to note before starting, I created this using Railo Express and MySQL 5

1. Create a Database and populate using the db_stuff/db_script.sql
2. Create a Datasource in CF Admin pointing to the database (I used cfObjective, refactor if you like)
